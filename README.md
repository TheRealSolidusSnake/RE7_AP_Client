## I need general help.

We have a Discord thread dedicated to this rando! Join the Archipelago After Dark server here and look for the RE7 thread: https://discord.gg/Sbhy4ykUKn

## Help, I found a bug!

Don't report any bugs, as there are tons if you use this as is and they're all very well known.
